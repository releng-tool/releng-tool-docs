"releng-tool is made on Python. Package configurations, scripts, etc. are "
"Python-compatible scripts, which releng-tool accepts for processing "
"configuration files and invoking other tools on a host system. While releng-"
"tool supports running on various host systems (e.g. Linux, OS X, Windows, "
"etc.), this guide will primarily show examples following a Unix-styled file "

"Depending on the host and how releng-tool has been [installed](/install), "
"this tool can be either executed using the call `releng-tool` (if supported)"
" or explicitly through a Python invoke `python -m releng-tool`. This guide "
"will assume the former option is available for use. If the alias command is "
"not available on the host system, the latter call can be used instead. For "
"example, the two commands shown below can be considered equivalent:"
