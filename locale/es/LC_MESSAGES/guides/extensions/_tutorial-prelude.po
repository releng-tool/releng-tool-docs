"This tutorial does not cover steps on publishing an extension to an index "
"such as [PyPI][pypi]. Instead, steps will be provided to load a extension's "
"sources into the system path for releng-tool (which is optional whenever a "
"given extension can be installed from an index or runs in an environment "
"that already manages the installation of the extension)."
