"The above adds a function `releng_setup`, which releng-tool uses to "
"register the extension into the releng-tool engine. The function is "
"invoked during initialization by passing an application context (`app`) "
"which the extension can use to hook onto events and more. This extension "
"implements a function `my_awesome_postbuild_handler`, which is registered"
" on the `post-build-finished` event. This allows the handler to be "
