"When fetching sources for a Git-site-defined package, releng-tool will keep "
"a project's Git repository inside a cache folder and use the project's build"
" directory as the Git work-tree. When extracting a given revision for a "
"project, releng-tool will also attempt to setup a `.git` file to point to "
"the cache directory, if users want to perform Git-related commands "
"(typically, only for unique development/testing scenarios)."

"In the case where developers want a complete copy of the Git repository in "
"the build folder instead of a pointer to the cache, the "
"`releng.git.replicate_cache` quirk can be enabled to force releng-tool to "
"copy over the Git repository when a package is extracted."
