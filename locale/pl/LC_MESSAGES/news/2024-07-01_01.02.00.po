"To help improve the user experience, when releng-tool is now operating in"

"sources already setup, releng-tool will attempt to prepare the package "
"automatically. For supported version control systems, when a repository "
"is detected as missing, releng-tool will use the package's site to "
"automatically clone/checkout sources. Supported types are as follows:"

"For a releng-tool run, packages will go through various stages (fetching,"
" configuration, building, etc.) followed by any post-stage scripts. Once "
"a package has been processed, it will not repeat a stage until the output"
" is cleaned. Users do have means to perform [rebuilds](/getting-"
"started/rebuilds), although users need to explicitly request "
"reconfigurations, rebuilds, etc. on specific packages based on what they "
"may be working on. If a developer is updating several packages, which may"
" be common in a [local-sources mode](/guides/local-sources-mode), the "
"developer may need to explicitly request a re-action on multiple packages"
" which can be time-consuming."

"It allows a user to hint to releng-tool to force processing each package,"
" even if a package has already completed stages before. Specifically, "
"when running with a [`punch`](action-punch) action, a releng-tool run "
"will operate very similar as if the action was not set. However, if a "
"package has already be configured, built or installed; these actions will"
" be performed again in the same manner as if a user invoked "
"[`<package>-reconfigure`](action-pkg-reconfigure), [`<package>-rebuild"
"`](action-pkg-rebuild) or [`<package>-reinstall`](action-pkg-reinstall); "
"respectively. This may be time-consuming for a run to repeat these "
"stages, but helps a user avoid needing to run multiple commands for a "
"desired rebuild."

"Note that this is similar to what the [`--force`](arg-force) argument "

"Introducing this action should help support a possible "
"deprecation/repurpose, if needed."
