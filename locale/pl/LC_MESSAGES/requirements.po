"releng-tool is developed in [Python][python] and requires either "
"[Python][python] 2.7 or 3.4+ to run on a host system. A series of "
"optional tools are required if certain stages or features are used. For "
"example, projects fetching sources from [Git][git] will require the `git`"
" tool installed; projects with patches will required the `patch` tool. "
"While some features may be operating system-specific (e.g. autotools "
"features are designed for Linux-based hosts), releng-tool can work on "
"various operating system variants."
