"performs fetch-like calls (e.g. if custom files are downloaded when running "
"a `libfoo-build` script), releng-tool will not stop the script from "
"performing this request. Offline builds are only possible if developers "
"define their projects in a way where fetching-like operations only occur "
"during a fetch-stage."
