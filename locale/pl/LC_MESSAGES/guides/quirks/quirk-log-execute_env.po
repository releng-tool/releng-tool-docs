"When releng-tool is configured with [`--debug`](arg-debug), the tool will"
" log (among other things) process executions. Debugging can print "
"information such as working directory of an execution, as well as "
"arguments used for a call. The environment for an execution is not logged"
" by default. For users wishing to include this information as well before"
" an invoked process, the `releng.log.execute_env` quick can be used."
