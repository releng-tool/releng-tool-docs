"For CMake-based projects, releng-tool will populate a series of include "
"directories (internally or from a project's configuration definition) to "
"configure a CMake project with. These include paths will be populated into "
"the [`CMAKE_INCLUDE_PATH`][cmake-include-path] option when generating native"
" build scripts."

"In addition to `CMAKE_INCLUDE_PATH`, releng-tool will also populate multiple"
" language type's [`CMAKE_<LANG>_STANDARD_INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES`][cmake-std-"
"includes] as well. This registers convenient include paths for languages "
"(e.g. C/C++), avoiding the need for project definitions to explicitly "
"configure common include paths in host, staging or target areas."

"However, if this causes issues for a build environment (such as when "
"building a CMake project with a toolchain file which has issues with "
"standard include overrides), the option can be disabled using the "
"`releng.cmake.disable_direct_includes` quirk:"
