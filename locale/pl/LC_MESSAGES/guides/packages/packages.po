"There is no explicit limit on the total number of packages a project can "
"have. Package names are recommended to be lower-case with dash-separated "
"(`-`) separators (if needed). For example, `package-a` is recommended "

"developer making the releng-tool project."

"string based on the package name with special characters converted to "
