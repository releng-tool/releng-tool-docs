"During the configuration stage of a Cargo package, `cargo` will be "

"defined dependencies defined in `Cargo.toml`. After all dependencies are "
"acquired, a build stage will be triggered using `cargo build`, followed "
"by an installation stage using `cargo install`. Each stage can be "

"Cargo executable."
