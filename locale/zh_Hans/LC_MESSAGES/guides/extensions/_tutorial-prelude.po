"This tutorial does not cover steps on publishing an extension to an index"
" such as [PyPI][pypi]. Instead, steps will be provided to load a "
"extension's sources into the system path for releng-tool (which is "
"optional whenever a given extension can be installed from an index or "
"runs in an environment that already manages the installation of the "
"extension)."
