"releng-tool can be used to assist in the building of a project. This tool "
"allows a user to define one or more packages to process. Each package has "
"the ability to perform several stages: fetching, extraction, patching, "
"configuration, building and installation. What a package defines will vary "
"for a given project. The simplest type of package is script-based that "
"allows a user to define custom scripts on how to perform various stages. A "
"package is not required to handle every stage. Helper package types are "
"provided (e.g. autotools, CMake, etc.), for projects using common build "
"capabilities."

"While this tool can assist in the configuration and building of a project, "
"the framework does not attempt to provide a perfect sandbox for the process."
" Users defining their projects will have ownership on what "
"compilers/toolchains are used and the interaction between the staging/target"
" area and the host system."
