"releng-tool aims to provide a way for developers to tailor the building "
"of multiple software components to help prepare packages for desired "
"runtime environments (e.g. cross-platform portable packages, embedded "
"targets, etc.). When building a package, assets may be located in "
"multiple locations and may require various methods to extract, build and "
"more. releng-tool allows developers to define a set of packages, "
"specifying where resources should be fetched from, how packages should be"
" extracted and the processes for patching, configuring, building and "
"installing each package for a target sysroot."

"The structure of a package depends on the specific project. The simplest "
"type is a script-based package, where users can define custom scripts for"
" various stages. A package does not need to handle every stage. Helper "
"package types are available (e.g. Autotools, Cargo, CMake, Make, Meson, "
"various Python types and SCons) for projects using common build systems."

"While releng-tool assists in configuring and building projects, it does "
"not aim to provide a perfect sandbox for the process. Users are "
"responsible for defining the compilers/toolchains used and managing the "
"interaction between the staging/target area with the host system."
msgstr ""
"Obwohl dieses Tool bei der Konfiguration und dem Aufbau eines Projekts "
"helfen kann, versucht das Framework nicht, eine perfekte Sandbox "
"bereitzustellen. Benutzer, die ihre Projekte definieren, haben die "
"Verantwortung daf√ºr, welche Compiler/Toolchains verwendet werden und wie "
"der Staging-/Zielbereich mit dem Hostsystem zusammenwirkt."
