"releng-tool is developed in [Python][python] and requires either "
"[Python][python] 3.9+ to run on a host system. A series of optional tools"
" are required if certain stages or features are used. For example, "
"projects fetching sources from [Git][git] will require the `git` tool "
"installed; projects with patches will required the `patch` tool. While "
"some features may be operating system-specific (e.g. Autotools features "
"are designed for Linux-based hosts), releng-tool can work on various "
"operating system variants."
