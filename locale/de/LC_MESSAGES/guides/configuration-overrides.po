"It is never recommended to persist a configuration overrides file into a "

"The `override_revisions` option inside a configuration override script "
"allows a dictionary to be provided to map a package name to a new "
"revision value. Consider the following example: a project defines "
"`module-a` and `module-b` packages with package `module-b` depending on "
"package `module-a`. A developer may be attempting to tweak package "
"`module-b` on the fly to test a new capabilities against the current "
"stable version of `module-a`. However, the developer does not want to "
"explicitly change the revision inside package `module-b`'s definition. To"
" avoid this, an override can be used instead:"

"`git@example.com:myproject.git`. However, the host `example.com` cannot "
"be access from the host machine. If a mirror location has been setup at "
"`git@example.org:myproject.git`, the following override can be used:"
