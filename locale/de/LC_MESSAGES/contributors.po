"Packages can describe where external content should be fetched from. The "

"similar fashion as fetching an archive from HTTP/FTP locations, or sources "
"can be fetched into a \"cache directory\" if supported (typically "
"distributed version controlled sources). For example, [Git][git] "
"repositories (see also Git's [`--git-dir`][--git-dir] will be stored in the "
"root directory's cache folder (e.g. `<ROOT>/cache`). During the extraction "
"stage, target revisions will be pulled from the cache location using the "

"In most cases, the extraction phase will process archives (e.g. `.tar.gz`, "

"[Mercurial][mercurial] sources have their own extraction implementations to "
"pull content from their respective distributed file systems into a package's"
" build working directory."
