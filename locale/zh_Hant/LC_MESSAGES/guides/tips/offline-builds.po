"performs fetch-like calls (e.g. if custom files are downloaded when "
"running a `libfoo-build` script), releng-tool will not stop the script "
"from performing this request. Offline builds are only possible if "
"developers define their projects in a way where fetching-like operations "
"only occur during a fetch-stage."
