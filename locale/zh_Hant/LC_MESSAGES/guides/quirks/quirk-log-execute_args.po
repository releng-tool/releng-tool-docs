"When releng-tool is configured with [`--debug`](arg-debug), the tool will"
" log (among other things) process executions. Debugging can print "
"information such as working directory of an execution, as well as "
"arguments used for a call. For some commands, the command line and "
"arguments can be long and may be difficult to quickly scan for issues. To"
" help improve the use experience, the `releng.log.execute_args` quick can"
" be used to print each argument on their own line."
