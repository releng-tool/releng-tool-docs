"A releng-tool project can use an extension by registering the extension "
"name in the `extensions` configuration option inside the project "
"configuration (`releng`). For example, to load an extension "
"`my_awesome_extension` into releng-tool, the following can be defined:"

"During the initial stages of a releng-tool process, the process will "
"check and load any configured extension. In the event that an extension "
"is missing, is unsupported for the running releng-tool version or fails "
"to load; a detailed error message will be presented to the user."

"Extensions are typically Python packages installed for the running Python"
" environment. If extensions are not packaged/installed, users can "
"alternatively append the location of an extension implementation into the"
" system path in the releng-tool configuration file. For example, if a "
"user has a releng-tool project checked out alongside a checked out "
"extension in a folder named `my-awesome-extension`, the extension's path "
"can be registered into the system path using the following:"

" API interfaces and documentation for these interfaces can be found "

"API folder aims to be \"API safe\" -- there is a strong attempt to "
"prevent the changing of classes, methods, etc. to prevent compatibility "
"issues as both releng-tool and extensions (if any) evolve."
