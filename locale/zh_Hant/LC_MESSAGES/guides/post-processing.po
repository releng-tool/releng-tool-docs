"At this time, releng-tool supports only post-build scripts. It is planned"
" to introduced support for some image-related helpers (i.e. package "
"helpers). This may introduce a reserved `releng-tool-post-image.rt` "
"script in future releases."

"After each package has been processed, a project has the ability to "
"perform post-processing. Post-processing allows a developer to cleanup "
"the target directory, build an archive/package from generated results and"
" more. If a project contains a `releng-tool-post-build.rt` inside the "
"root directory, the post-processing script will be invoked in the final "
"stage of a build."

"It is important to note that post-processing scripts will be invoked each"
" time a `releng-tool` invoke reaches the final stage of a build. A "
"developer should attempt to implement the post-processing scripts in a "
"way that it can be invoked multiple times. For example, if a developer "
"decides to move a file out of the target directory into an interim "
"directory when building an archive, it is most likely that a subsequent "
"request to build may fail since the file can no longer be found inside "
"the target directory."
