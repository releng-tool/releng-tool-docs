"It is never recommended to persist a configuration overrides file into a "

"The `override_extract_tools` option inside a configuration override "
"script allows a dictionary to be provided to map an extension type to an "
"external tool to indicate which tool should be used for extraction. For "
"example, when a `.zip` archive is being processed for extraction, releng-"
"tool will internally extract the archive. However, a user may wish to "
"override this tool with their own extraction utility. Consider the "
"following example:"

"The `override_revisions` option inside a configuration override script "
"allows a dictionary to be provided to map a package name to a new "
"revision value. Consider the following example: a project defines "
"`module-a` and `module-b` packages with package `module-b` depending on "
"package `module-a`. A developer may be attempting to tweak package "
"`module-b` on the fly to test a new capabilities against the current "
"stable version of `module-a`. However, the developer does not want to "
"explicitly change the revision inside package `module-b`'s definition. To"
" avoid this, an override can be used instead:"

"The `override_sites` option inside a configuration override script allows"
" a dictionary to be provided to map a package name to a new site value. "
"There may be times where a host may not have access to a specific package"
" site. To have a host to use a mirror location without having to adjust "
"the package definition, the site override option can be used. For "
"example, consider a package pulls from site "
"`git@example.com:myproject.git`. However, the host `example.com` cannot "
"be access from the host machine. If a mirror location has been setup at "
"`git@example.org:myproject.git`, the following override can be used:"

"Environment variables can be used to help override external tool invoked "
"by the releng-tool process. For example, when invoking CMake-based "
"projects, the tool `cmake` will be invoked. However, if a builder is "
"running on CentOS and CMake v3.x is desired, the tool `cmake3` needs to "
"be invoked instead. To configure this, an environment variable can be set"
" to switch which tool to invoke. Consider the following example:"
