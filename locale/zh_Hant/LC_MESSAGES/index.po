"releng-tool can be used to assist in the building of a project. This tool"
" allows a user to define one or more packages to process. Each package "
"has the ability to perform several stages: fetching, extraction, "
"patching, configuration, building and installation. What a package "
"defines will vary for a given project. The simplest type of package is "
"script-based that allows a user to define custom scripts on how to "
"perform various stages. A package is not required to handle every stage. "
"Helper package types are provided (e.g. autotools, CMake, etc.), for "
"projects using common build capabilities."

"While this tool can assist in the configuration and building of a "
"project, the framework does not attempt to provide a perfect sandbox for "
"the process. Users defining their projects will have ownership on what "
"compilers/toolchains are used and the interaction between the "
"staging/target area and the host system."
