msgid "When releng-tool is configured with [`--debug`](arg-debug), the tool will log (among other things) process executions. Debugging can print information such as working directory of an execution, as well as arguments used for a call. For some commands, the command line and arguments can be long and may be difficult to quickly scan for issues. To help improve the use experience, the `releng.log.execute_args` quick can be used to print each argument on their own line."
