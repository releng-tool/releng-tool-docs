msgid "For CMake-based projects, releng-tool will populate a series of include directories (internally or from a project's configuration definition) to configure a CMake project with. These include paths will be populated into the [`CMAKE_INCLUDE_PATH`][cmake-include-path] option when generating native build scripts."

msgid "In addition to `CMAKE_INCLUDE_PATH`, releng-tool will also populate multiple language type's [`CMAKE_<LANG>_STANDARD_INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES`][cmake-std-includes] as well. This registers convenient include paths for languages (e.g. C/C++), avoiding the need for project definitions to explicitly configure common include paths in host, staging or target areas."
