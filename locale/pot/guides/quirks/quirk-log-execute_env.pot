msgid "When releng-tool is configured with [`--debug`](arg-debug), the tool will log (among other things) process executions. Debugging can print information such as working directory of an execution, as well as arguments used for a call. The environment for an execution is not logged by default. For users wishing to include this information as well before an invoked process, the `releng.log.execute_env` quick can be used."
