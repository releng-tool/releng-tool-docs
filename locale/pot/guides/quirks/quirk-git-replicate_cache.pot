msgid "When fetching sources for a Git-site-defined package, releng-tool will keep a project's Git repository inside a cache folder and use the project's build directory as the Git work-tree. When extracting a given revision for a project, releng-tool will also attempt to setup a `.git` file to point to the cache directory, if users want to perform Git-related commands (typically, only for unique development/testing scenarios)."

msgid "In the case where developers want a complete copy of the Git repository in the build folder instead of a pointer to the cache, the `releng.git.replicate_cache` quirk can be enabled to force releng-tool to copy over the Git repository when a package is extracted."
