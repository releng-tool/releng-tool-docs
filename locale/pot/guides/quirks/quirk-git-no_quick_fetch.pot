msgid "When fetching sources for a Git-site-defined package, releng-tool will attempt to acquire these sources by only pulling applicable revision references needed for a build (i.e. \"quick fetching\", in the context of releng-tool). For example, if a project defines a Git tag to fetch, only the `refs/tags/<tag>` reference will be fetched."
