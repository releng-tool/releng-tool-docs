msgid "During the configuration stage of a CMake package, `cmake` will be invoked to generate build files for the module. For the build stage, `cmake --build` will invoke the generated build files. Similar approach for the installation stage where the build option is invoked again but with the `install` target invoked: `cmake --build --target install`. Each stage can be configured to manipulate environment variables and options used by the CMake executable."

Ideally, projects will have an [install][cmake-install] rule configured to define how a project will install files into a target (or staging) environment. Not all CMake projects may have this rule defined, which can cause the installation stage for a package to fail. A developer can specify this no-install flag to skip a CMake-driven install request and manage installation actions through other means (such as post-processing).
