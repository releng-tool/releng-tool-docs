"When fetching sources for a Git-site-defined package, releng-tool will "
"keep a project's Git repository inside a cache folder and use the "
"project's build directory as the Git work-tree. When extracting a given "
"revision for a project, releng-tool will also attempt to setup a `.git` "
"file to point to the cache directory, if users want to perform Git-"
"related commands (typically, only for unique development/testing "
"scenarios)."

"In the case where developers want a complete copy of the Git repository "
"in the build folder instead of a pointer to the cache, the "
"`releng.git.replicate_cache` quirk can be enabled to force releng-tool to"
" copy over the Git repository when a package is extracted."
