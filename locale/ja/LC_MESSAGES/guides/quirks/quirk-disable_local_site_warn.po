"Users can create packages using a [local site](site-local) for initial "
"development and testing scenarios. However, using local sites is not "
"recommended for long-term use; hence a warning is generated when releng-"
"tool runs. While the warning aims to promote a user to move the package "
"into their own site of some sort (e.g. Git), a user may be good enough "
"with using a specific package as a local one. For such cases, using this "
"quirk can prevent any warnings generated when a local site is used."
