"A releng-tool project may require various dependencies. For example, if a "
"package define a Git-based site for sources, the `git` client will be "
"required to clone these sources into a build directory. To help inform users"
" of issues in the early stage of a build, releng-tool will perform a "
"prerequisites check for certain dependencies. If a prerequisite cannot be "
"found, the build process stops immediately."

"In select scenarios, the prerequisite check may wish to be skipped. For "
"example, if the running environment is not expected to perform a specific "
"action in a project that requires an application. To avoid triggering a run "
"error at start, users may set the `releng.disable_prerequisites_check` quirk"
" to skip any prerequisite check:"
