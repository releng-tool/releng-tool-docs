"If a developer defines a package definition or a post-build script which "
"performs fetch-like calls (e.g. if custom files are downloaded when "
"running a `libfoo-build` script), releng-tool will not stop the script "
"from performing this request. Offline builds are only possible if "
"developers define their projects in a way where fetching-like operations "
"only occur during a fetch-stage."

"If a package defines additional dependencies (e.g. Cargo packages), "
