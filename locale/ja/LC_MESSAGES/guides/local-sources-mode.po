"Local-sources mode provides a way for a developer to build internal-flagged "
"packages using sources found alongside the root directory (or a specific "
"provided directory), instead of having releng-tool attempt to fetch them "
"from remote instances. This is primarily for developers who desire to "
"manually manage source content outside the releng-tool environment. Local-"
"sources mode only works for internally flagged packaged. Consider the "
"following example: a releng-tool project has a package called `liba`. When "
"releng-tool is invoked in normal configurations, the package will do "
"fetching, extraction and patching to prepare the directory "
"`<root>/output/build/liba-<version>`. However, if a builder has configured "
"the working root for local-sources mode, sources for `liba` will be used "
"from the folder `<root>/../liba` instead:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../content/guides/local-sources-mode.md:33
msgid ""
"When in local-sources mode, an internal package will skip the fetching, "
"extraction and patching stages in order to prevent undesired manipulation of"
" developer-prepared sources. Another consideration to note is the use of "
"clean operators while in local-sources mode. Continuing with the above "
"example, if a user invokes `releng-tool liba-clean`, the operation will not "
"remove the `<root>/../liba` folder. Responsibility to managing a clean "
"`liba` package will be left with the user."

"To enable local-sources mode, invoking `releng-tool` with the `--local-"
"sources` (or `-L`) argument will enable the mode. Future calls to releng-"
"tool for the project will use local sources for packages defined as internal"
" packages. For example:"
