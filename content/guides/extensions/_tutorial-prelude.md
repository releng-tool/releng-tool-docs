- This extension example uses the name `my-awesome-extension`. Developers are
  free to change this with whatever name is applicable for their own
  extension.
- This extension example assumes a Python 3-supported interpreter. Developers
  looking to support running under a Python 2 interpreter may require
  additional steps not covered in this tutorial.
- This tutorial does not cover steps on publishing an extension to an index
  such as [PyPI][pypi]. Instead, steps will be provided to load a extension's
  sources into the system path for releng-tool (which is optional whenever
  a given extension can be installed from an index or runs in an environment
  that already manages the installation of the extension).
