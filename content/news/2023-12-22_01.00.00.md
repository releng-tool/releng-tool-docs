# 1.0 (2023-12-22)

## Marking a 1.0 release!

releng-tool has had several beta releases over the last couple of years.
Multiple enhancements and fixes have been applied during this period,
putting this tool in what appears to be a good state. With the updates
made to the documentation, now is a good time as any to flag this tool
into a first stable v1.0 release.

## New script and script-directory context variables

As various scripts are invoked during a releng-tool run, developers may
wish to determine the path of the running script or the directory which
an active script is running (whether this is a build script for a package,
a post-build script, etc.).

Changes have been introduced into releng-tool so that any time a script
is executed, the variables `RELENG_SCRIPT` and `RELENG_SCRIPT_DIR` will be
set. This includes global contexts as well as environment variables. The
variable `RELENG_SCRIPT` will be set to the absolute path of the running
script. As for `RELENG_SCRIPT_DIR`, the value will be a subset of the script
path, holding the absolute path of the directory holding the script.

When using script helpers such as `releng_include`, the values of
`RELENG_SCRIPT` and `RELENG_SCRIPT_DIR` will be updated in the included
context for the included script.
