# 2.1 (2025-02-17)

## Adding share directory environment/script variables

While releng-tool's previous releases included path helpers for a project's
`bin`/`include`/`lib` directories (e.g.
[`TARGET_INCLUDE_DIR`](env-target-include-dir)), no helpers existed for a
`share` path. This release introduces support for the following new variables:

- [`HOST_SHARE_DIR`](env-host-share-dir)
- [`STAGING_SHARE_DIR`](env-staging-share-dir)
- [`TARGET_SHARE_DIR`](env-target-share-dir)

## Default `CMAKE_MODULE_PATH` support

[CMake](/guides/packages/pkg-type-cmake) packages now populate a
[`CMAKE_MODULE_PATH`][cmake-module-path] configuration by default. The value
used for this option is a share-folder path (`share/cmake/Modules`) based on
the configured [`LIBFOO_INSTALL_TYPE`](pkg-opt-install-type).

For example, a project configured to use the staging area may have the
following path configured:

```none
<root-dir>/output/staging/usr/share/cmake/Modules
```

CMake packages which install provided modules into the standard share path
can be automatically used by other CMake dependent packages.

## Usability improvements to local-sources

Two minor tweaks have been made towards the
[local-sources](/guides/local-sources-mode) capability. For package-specific
overrides, users can now include a `package/` prefix as part of the package
name. For example, projects would typically register a local-sources
override for `libfoo` using:

```none
releng-tool --local-sources libfoo:/mnt/code/libfoo
 (or)
releng-tool -L libfoo:/mnt/code/libfoo
```

With this release, the above example and below example will result in the
same configuration applied:

```none
releng-tool --local-sources package/libfoo:/mnt/code/libfoo
 (or)
releng-tool -L package/libfoo:/mnt/code/libfoo
```

This allows users to easily populate desired packages in a shell environment
that supports completions.

Second, clearing all local-sources configurations can now be cleared using a
single `unset` request. For example:

```none
releng-tool --local-sources unset
 (or)
releng-tool -L unset
```
